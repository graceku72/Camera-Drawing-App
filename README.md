The Sketch Tagger of this Android application enables users to create drawings on the screen, with options to either clear the drawing area or save the sketch to a SQLite database, along with user-provided tags. Similar functionality is offered by the Photo Tagger, but for capturing images with a device’s camera.

In the tag input field, suggested tags appear after the drawing or photo capture is complete, with the image being sent to the Google Cloud Vision API for classification. The user can edit these tags before saving the picture, if they wish to do so. Saved pictures can be searched by tags, displaying the matching images sorted by recency, along with their timestamps and associated tags.

The Story Teller allows users to select up to three images, with an option to exclude sketches. It then uses TextCortex AI to generate a tweet based on the tag words associated with the selected images, which is subsequently read aloud.

To improve user experience, background music plays throughout the entire application.
